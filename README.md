## How We Implemented These Metrics

To make UgaTours better, we added some features to track and improve the platform:

1. Tracking Bookings
- Every time someone books a tour, we count it in the database.
- This helps us see which tours are popular and which ones need improvement.

2. Measuring Booking Time
- When someone starts booking a tour, we start a timer.
- When they finish booking, we stop the timer and save the time it took.
- This helps us make the booking process faster and smoother.

3. Collecting User Feedback
- After booking, users can rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5.
- We use this feedback to improve our tours and services.
