## How We Measure Success

We care about making UgaTours better for you. Here’s how we track our progress:

1. Number of Bookings: We count how many tours are booked to see how popular they are.
2. Booking Time: We measure how long it takes to book a tour to make the process faster.
3. User Feedback: After booking, we ask users how satisfied they are to improve our services.


## How We Implemented These Metrics

To make UgaTours better, we added some features to track and improve the platform:

1. Tracking Bookings
- Every time someone books a tour, we count it in the database.
- This helps us see which tours are popular and which ones need improvement.

2. Measuring Booking Time
- When someone starts booking a tour, we start a timer.
- When they finish booking, we stop the timer and save the time it took.
- This helps us make the booking process faster and smoother.

3. Collecting User Feedback
- After booking, users can rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5.
- We use this feedback to improve our tours and services.

## Generating PDFs with TCPDF

We use the TCPDF library to generate PDFs for booking confirmations. Here’s how it works:

1. After Booking: When a user books a tour, we create a PDF with their booking details (e.g., tour name, price, date).
2. PDF Features:
   - Includes tour details like name, description, price, and duration.
   - Displays a thank-you message and contact information.
3. User Experience: Users can download or print the PDF for their records.
